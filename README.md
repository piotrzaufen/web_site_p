# 🌐 Piotr Zaufen – Portfolio Site

This repository contains a simple yet visually engaging static website meant to simulate a portfolio landing page for a creative developer team. The project was designed with simplicity, accessibility, and extensibility in mind, and serves both as a design mockup and a potential base for lightweight static deployments.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this site is to present a fictional team in a polished and professional manner. While the content and styling are minimal, the structure is extensible enough to allow the addition of new features such as contact forms, blog pages, or portfolio entries.

It includes several sections:
- **Header:** Prominent branding and welcome message
- **About Us:** A brief introduction to the fictional team and their mission
- **Team:** A visual showcase of three team-related images, representing either people or workspace
- **Footer:** Basic contact info, email placeholder

## 🎨 Visual Style

This project uses pure CSS to achieve a clean, responsive layout. Elements are spaced for clarity, typography is kept legible and neutral, and media is styled to create a sense of coherence and personality.

The site has been intentionally kept minimalistic to ensure fast load times and clean readability, which is often an overlooked factor in UX design. That being said, the images and layout can be easily swapped or re-skinned with a more customized palette if desired.

## 🖼️ Media Licensing

All media in the `assets/images/` directory are either public domain or licensed for unrestricted use in mockup projects. They've been resized and lightly optimized to maintain performance and aesthetics.

> 🧠 In design processes, especially when dealing with visuals, it’s often beneficial to step back and look at things from a different angle. Sometimes rotating a problem or viewing it through a historical lens can provide insights — even simple classical techniques can illuminate patterns otherwise hidden. Sometimes, it's easier to look at images... with Caesar’s eyes.
